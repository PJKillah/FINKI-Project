        <p class="mainp2">Samurai (侍) were the hereditary <br> military nobility and officer caste of <br>
            medieval and early-modern Japan <br> from the late 12th century to their <br> 
            abolition in 1876. They were the <br> well-paid retainers of the daimyo <br>
            (the great feudal landholders).</p>

        <p class="historyp">History</p>
        <p class="historyp2">This is the history period of Samurai in Japan, they live in some period <br> and conquer 
        and protect Japan from invasion.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Asuka and Nara periods</li>
            <p>Following the Battle of Hakusukinoe against Tang China and Silla in <br> 663 AD, which 
                led to a retreat from Korean affairs, Japan underwent <br> widespread reform. One of the 
                most important was that of the Taika <br> Reform, issued by Prince Naka-no-õe (Emperor Tenji) in 646.</p>
            <li>Heian period</li>
            <p>In the early Heian period, during the late 8th and early 9th <br> centuries, Emperor Kanmu sought to consolidate 
                and expand his rule <br> in northern Honshū and sent military campaigns against the Emishi, <br> who resisted the 
                governance of the Kyoto-based imperial court.</p>
            <li>Late Heian period, Kamakura Bakufu</li>
            <p>The Kamakura period (1185-1333) saw the rise of the samurai under <br> shogun rule as they were
                 "entrusted with the security of the estates" <br> and were symbols of the ideal warrior and citizen. Originally, 
                 the <br> emperor and non-warrior nobility employed these warrior nobles.</p>
            <li>Ashikaga shogunate and the Mongol invasion</li>
            <p>The Mongol invasions of Japan took place in 1274 and 1281 CE when Kublai Khan <br> (r. 1260-1294 CE) sent two huge fleets
                 from Korea and China. In both cases, the Japanese, <br> and especially the samurai warriors, vigorously defended their shores 
                 but it would be <br> typhoon storms and the so-called kamikaze or 'divine winds' which sank and drowned <br> countless ships and men, 
                 thus saving Japan from foreign conquest.</p>
        </ul>
